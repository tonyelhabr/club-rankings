## Introduction

This repo scrapes and stores the club rankings published by [Opta Analyst](https://theanalyst.com/na/2023/03/who-are-the-best-football-team-in-the-world-opta-power-rankings/), [FiveThirtyEight](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/soccer-predictions/global-), and [Club Elo](http://clubelo.com/). The data is automatically pushed to [Github releases](https://github.com/tonyelhabr/releases).

## Data

| Source | Download |
| :----- | :------- |
| Opta Analyst | [Download](https://github.com/tonyelhabr/club-rankings/releases/download/club-rankings/opta-club-rankings.csv) |
| FiveThirtyEight | [Download](https://github.com/tonyelhabr/club-rankings/releases/download/club-rankings/fivethirtyeight-club-rankings.csv) |
| Club Elo | [Download](https://github.com/tonyelhabr/club-rankings/releases/download/club-rankings/clubelo-club-rankings.csv) |

In addition, I've added [a release file](https://github.com/tonyelhabr/releases/download/compared-rankings.csv) that compares the two table (using [a mapping file](https://github.com/tonyelhabr/blob/main/team-mapping.csv) that I manually created).

### Dictionary

#### Club Rankings

Each file has the columns from the raw source, plus two additional ones

* `date`: The date on which the data was retrieved, in `%Y-%m-%d` format.
* `updated_at`: The exact time at which the data was retrieved, in `%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S` format.

In cases where the Github action is manually triggered, there may be multiple entries per day for a given team.

Opta Analyst source fields:

* `rank`
* `team`
* `rating`
* `ranking change 7 days`

FiveThirtyEight source fields:

* `rank`
* `prev_rank`
* `name`
* `league`
* `off`
* `def`
* `spi`

Club Elo source fields:

* `Rank`
* `Club`
* `Country`
* `Level`: league tier, i.e. 1 for top league in country
* `Elo`
* `From`: starting date from which elo is constant, presumably the day after a match
* `To`: end data to which elo is constant, presumably the current date or the last day prior to a match day

#### Comparison

Comparison file fields:

* `date`
* `league_538`
* `league_538_alternative`: manually defined league name where 538 lists "UEFA Champions League", "UEFA Europa Conference League", or "UEFA Europa League"
* `league_clubelo`
* `team_538`
* `id_opta`
* `team_clubelo`
* `rank_538`
* `rank_opta`
* `rating_538`
* `rating_opta`

Note that the only Opta teams (over 13k) that can be mapped to FiveThirtyEight teams (around 650) are included in the comparison file. (Mapping Club Elo teams is a work in progress.)
